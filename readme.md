# Email Web Scraper

The Email Scraper is a Python-based tool that extracts publicly available email addresses from websites.


## Key Features

- **Proxy Rotation**: Uses your own proxy for scraping. `No proxy rotation`.
- **Batch Processing**: Runs multiple scripts simultaneously, drastically `reducing processing time`.
- **Progress Tracking**: Each process displays an `individual progress bar` for clear and real-time updates.

## Support  
I spent days trying to implement proxy rotation, but unfortunately, I couldn't get it to work with BeautifulSoup (BS4). While proxies work fine with Playwright, I found it wasn't a critical feature for this tool. Proxy rotation is most useful when scraping the same website multiple times, but since this tool is designed for scraping multiple different websites, it doesnâ€™t present a major issue.

If you find this tool useful, consider supporting me with a coffee on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/xgino). Every sip helps fuel a new line of code. Thank you for your support, and keep coding!


## Disclaimer
This tool is designed to scrape **publicly visible email addresses** from websites while fully respecting the `robots.txt` guidelines. It ensures that scraping is done in a **timely manner**, avoiding overloading websites, especially since most websites may not have robust servers. This approach minimizes the risk of causing any disruption.

Since the email addresses are **publicly visible** on these websites, collecting them is generally allowed. However, you must be mindful of regulations such as **GDPR** and other data protection laws, especially when handling **personal data**. 

It is essential to:
- **Use the collected email addresses responsibly**.
- **Never share or misuse** the data.

In addition, take care in **storing this data securely** to prevent leaks or unauthorized access. Always ensure that any email addresses collected are used **only for lawful and ethical purposes**.

Before using this tool:
- **Check your local laws** to ensure full compliance.
- Always **scrape responsibly**, respecting both the websites you scrape from and the privacy of individuals.
